    <p>Pikachu is one of the most beloved creatures in the Pokemon universe.
      Possessing, many traits that make him seem almost human-like, he feels like
      a bridge of sorts between the more scary and almost alien Pokemon and
      the humans who train them, making them seem more understandable through
      his loveability. Pikachu is:</p>
    <p></p>
    <ul>
      <li id="Friendly">Friendly</li>
      <li id="Loyal">Loyal</li>
      <li id="Kind">Kind</li>
      <li id="Brave">Brave</li>
      <li id="Strong">Strong</li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>
    <p>Pikachu, in short, is everything we want in a human friend. But, he's a
      Pokemon!!! Poke that cheeky Pikachu anywhere for more info.</p>
